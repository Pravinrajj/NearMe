The Regional Transport Office (RTO) is a government organization established to oversee all transport-related operations in India. It exists in every state and Union Territory. RTO is responsible for carrying out the functions and activities of the Motor Vehicles Act, of 1988. Itâ€™s a government body that assures all the provisions of this central act is enforced in their regions. Moreover, the department also engages in various other activities like pollution checks, tax collection and enforcement of road transportation rules. In my city the rto is working very properly.
